## PE Injection Issues
I see your concerns here. I realize that re-working the imports table would be complicated, however I'm not a huge fan of these alternatives either...
	- I don't like the Launcher application, I'd rather the patch be applied, and the user be able to open kotor noramlly witout and special launcher program.
	- AppInit_DLLs will not work. Most users are on Win10 and Win11 these days
	- DLL Hijacking also just seems kinda messy. I'd like to just directly modify the EXE and work from there...
